# FluidSim

Valentin Miu ASE github assignment

Unifinished and broken fluid simulator. Makes some weird yellow smoke dots move around or something.

Modified from NCCA github code (https://github.com/NCCA) and code found on http://www.opengl-tutorial.org; the latter is distributed under a DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT license.

Instructions:

First two tabs don't work. For the third ("Bake"), select simulation parameters and press bake. Press "Free bake" to reset.

Click "show controls" to see how to operate the viewport and stuff.
